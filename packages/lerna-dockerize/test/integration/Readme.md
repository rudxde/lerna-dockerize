# Integration tests

The integration test setups can be used as examples for lerna dockerize.

In the sub-directories are project setups, where the Dockerfile.expected is the expected outcome of lerna dockerize. You can take a look inside the following folders:

* [Simple](./simple)
* [Config file](./config-file)
* [Custom dockerfile](./custom_dockerfile)
* [If exists](./if_exists)
* [split stages](./split-stages)
* [hoist](./hoist)
